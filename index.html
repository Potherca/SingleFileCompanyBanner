        <h1>Single File include for a "Brought to you by" banner</h1>
        <p>
            Every so often I create an online example of how something works.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As this sometimes occurs during working hours, I thought it might be 
            nice to add a simple banner thanking my employer for allowing us to
            exposing these things to a broader public.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The idea was to have a single file of Javascript that could be 
            included into any HTML page that would take care of all the work 
            needed to add a nice banner.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            After some experiments the final result is somewhat flexibel as to
            allow others to easily re-use the code for other companies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The URL that the banner should link to, the Name of the company and 
            any CSS class that should be added to the banner can be dynamically
            passed in through URL query/search parameters
        </p>
        
        <p>The banner at the bottom of this page is added with this line of HTML</p>
        
        <pre class="code" rel="Example Banner Include">
&lt;script src="colofon-banner.js?url=http://thebeanmachine.nl/&cssClass=colofon-beanmachine&companyName=The Bean Machine" id="colofon-banner-script"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </pre>
    </div>
    
    <script src="colofon-banner.js?url=http://thebeanmachine.nl/&cssClass=colofon-beanmachine&companyName=The Bean Machine" id="colofon-banner-script"></script>
