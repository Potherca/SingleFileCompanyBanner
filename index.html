        <h1>Single File include for a "Brought to you by" banner</h1>
        <p>
            Every so often I create an online example of how something works.
        </p>

        <p>
            As this sometimes occurs during working hours, I thought it might be
            nice to add a simple banner thanking my employer for allowing us to
            exposing these things to a broader public.
        </p>

        <p>
            The idea was to have a single file of Javascript that could be
            included into any HTML page that would take care of all the work
            needed to add a nice banner.
        </p>

        <p>
            After some experiments the final result is somewhat flexibel as to
            allow others to easily re-use the code for other companies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The URL that the banner should link to, the Name of the company and
            any CSS class that should be added to the banner can be dynamically
            passed in through URL query/search parameters
        </p>

        <p>
            The top-most banner at the bottom of this page is added with the
            following line of HTML:
        </p>

        <pre class="code" rel="Example Banner for my Current Employer">
&lt;script src="colofon-banner.js?companyName=The%20Bean%20Machine&linkColor=rgb(0,175,219)&hoverColor=rgba(0,175,219,0.65)&url=http://thebeanmachine.nl/&logo=http://www.thebeanmachine.nl/Static/Images/Default/logo.png"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </pre>

        <p>
            Because the content of the banner is defined by the parameters set
            for the script, it can be easily changed. See the banner all the way
            at the bottom.
        </p>

        <pre class="code" rel="Example Banner for IniTech">
&lt;script src="colofon-banner.js?companyName=Initech&linkColor=rgb(0,0,0)&hoverColor=rgba(0,0,0,0.65)&url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/&logo=http://www.peterjthomson.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Initech-Logo-No-Tagline.jpg&"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </pre>
